Guess The Number Game (Python)

This project is a command-line number guessing game developed using Python, where the computer randomly selects a number within a defined range, and the player attempts to guess it in the fewest possible attempts.

The game uses the random module to generate the secret number and continuously prompts the user for input until the correct number is guessed. After each guess, the program provides helpful feedback such as “Too High” or “Too Low”, allowing the player to refine their next attempt.

This project focuses on strengthening Python fundamentals, including loops, conditional statements, user input validation, counters, and basic game logic. It is ideal for beginners who want hands-on practice with interactive programs.
